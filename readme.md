## About this repository

This repository is intended to store my projects from freeCodeCamp. I'm constantly updating it, adding new stuff as soon as I finish building them.
I'm well aware that this repository isn't well structured, and that's because my learning process is growing still. Please be patient.

## Organization

Here follows the links to my current finished projects for a preview (disposed in order of creation):
