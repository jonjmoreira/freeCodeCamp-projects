        <p>
          JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
          While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event.
          JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>
          Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction.
          The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language.
          Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly so).
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java.
          Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for ... in), and source code recovery (JavaScript programs can decompile function bodies back into their source text).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Available_Implementations">
        <header>Available Implementations</header>
        <p>
          The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and has since been updated to conform to ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions.
          This engine, code named SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C/C++.
          The Rhino engine, created primarily by Norris Boyd (also at Netscape) is a JavaScript implementation written in Java.
          Like SpiderMonkey, Rhino is ECMA-262 Edition 5 compliant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several major runtime optimizations such as TraceMonkey (Firefox 3.5), JägerMonkey (Firefox 4) and IonMonkey were added to the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine over time.
          Work is always ongoing to improve JavaScript execution performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the above implementations, there are other popular JavaScript engines such as:-
          <ul>
            <li>Google's V8, which is used in the Google Chrome browser and recent versions of Opera browser. This is also the engine used by Node.js.</li>
            <li>The JavaScriptCore (SquirrelFish/Nitro) used in some WebKit browsers such as Apple Safari.</li>
            <li>Carakan in old versions of Opera.</li>
            <li>The Chakra engine used in Internet Explorer (although the language it implements is formally called "JScript" in order to avoid trademark issues).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another common application for JavaScript is as a (Web) server side scripting language.
          A JavaScript web server would expose host objects representing a HTTP request and response objects, which could then be manipulated by a JavaScript program to dynamically generate web pages.
          Node.js is a popular example of this.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript's types are:
          <ul>
            <li><code>Number</code></li>
            <li><code>BigInt</code></li>
            <li><code>String</code></li>
            <li><code>Boolean</code></li>
            <li>
              Object
              <ul>
                <li><code>Function</code></li>
                <li><code>Array</code></li>
                <li><code>Date</code></li>
                <li><code>RegExp</code></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code>null</code></li>
            <li><code>undefined</code></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Numbers">
        <header>Numbers</header>
        <p>
          ECMAScript has two built-in numeric types: <code>Number</code> and <code>BigInt</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>Number</code> type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value (numbers between -(2^53 − 1) and 2^53 − 1).
          And where this article and other MDN articles refer to "integers", what's usually meant is a representation of an integer using a <code>Number</code> value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, integer values are treated as 32-bit ints, and some implementations even store it that way until they are asked to perform an instruction that's valid on a <code>Number</code> but not on a 32-bit integer.
          This can be important for bit-wise operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard arithmetic operators are supported, including addition, subtraction, modulus (or remainder) arithmetic, and so forth.
          There's also a built-in object that we did not mention earlier called <code>Math</code> that provides advanced mathematical functions and constants.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can convert a string to an integer using the built-in <code>parseInt()</code> function.
          This takes the base for the conversion as an optional second argument, which you should always provide.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
        <header>Strings</header>
        <p>
          Strings in JavaScript are sequences of Unicode characters.
          This should be welcome news to anyone who has had to deal with internationalization.
          More accurately, they are sequences of UTF-16 code units; each code unit is represented by a 16-bit number.
          Each Unicode character is represented by either 1 or 2 code units.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to represent a single character, you just use a string consisting of that single character.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the length of a string (in code units), access its length property.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Other_Types">
        <header>Other Types</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript distinguishes between <code>null</code>, which is a value that indicates a deliberate non-value (and is only accessible through the null keyword), and <code>undefined</code>, which is a value of type undefined that indicates an uninitialized variable
           — that is, a value hasn't even been assigned yet. We'll talk about variables later, but in JavaScript it is possible to declare a variable without assigning a value to it. If you do this, the variable's type is <code>undefined</code>. <code>undefined</code> is actually a constant.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript has a boolean type, with possible values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> (both of which are keywords.) Any value can be converted to a boolean according to the following rules:
          <ul>
            <li><code>false</code>, <code>0</code>, empty strings <code>("")</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>null</code>, and <code>undefined</code> all become <code>false</code>.</li>
            <li>All other values become <code>true</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can perform this conversion explicitly using the <code>Boolean()</code> function.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this is rarely necessary, as JavaScript will silently perform this conversion when it expects a boolean, such as in an <code>if</code> statement.
          For this reason, we sometimes speak of "true values" and "false values," meaning values that become <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, respectively, when converted to booleans.
          Alternatively, such values can be called "truthy" and "falsy", respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boolean operations such as <code>&&</code> (logical and), <code>||</code> (logical or), and <code>!</code> (logical not) are supported.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          New variables in JavaScript are declared using one of three keywords: <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, or <code>var</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>let</code> allows you to declare block-level variables. The declared variable is available from the block it is enclosed in.</li>
            <li><code>const</code> allows you to declare variables whose values are never intended to change. The variable is available from the block it is declared in.</li>
            <li>
              <code>var</code> does not have the restrictions that the other two keywords have. This is because it was traditionally the only way to declare a variable in JavaScript.
              A variable declared with the <code>var</code> keyword is available from the function it is declared in.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          An important difference between JavaScript and other languages like Java is that in JavaScript, blocks do not have scope; only functions have a scope.
          So if a variable is defined using var in a compound statement (for example inside an if control structure), it will be visible to the entire function.
          However, starting with ECMAScript 2015, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> declarations allow you to create block-scoped variables.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Operators">
        <header>Operators</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript's numeric operators are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code> and <code>%</code> which is the remainder operator.
          Values are assigned using <code>=</code>, and there are also compound assignment statements such as <code>+=</code> and <code>-=</code>.
          These extend out to <code>x = x operator y</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> to increment and decrement respectively. These can be used as a prefix or postfix operators.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparisons in JavaScript can be made using <code><</code>, <code>></code>, <code><=</code> and <code>>=</code>.
          These work for both strings and numbers.
          Equality is a little less straightforward.
          The double-equals operator performs type coercion if you give it different types, with sometimes interesting results.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also <code>!=</code> and <code>!==</code> operators.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript also has bitwise operations. If you want to use them, they're there.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Control_Structures">
        <header>Control Structures</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript has a similar set of control structures to other languages in the C family.
          Conditional statements are supported by <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>; you can chain them together if you like.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript has <code>while</code> loops and <code>do-while</code> loops.
          The first is good for basic looping; the second for loops where you wish to ensure that the body of the loop is executed at least once.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript's <code>for</code> loop is the same as that in C and Java: it lets you provide the control information for your loop on a single line.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript also contains two other prominent for loops: <code>for...of</code> and <code>for...in</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>&&</code> and <code>||</code> operators use short-circuit logic, which means whether they will execute their second operand is dependent on the first.
          This is useful for checking for <code>null</code> objects before accessing their attributes:
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>switch</code> statement can be used for multiple branches based on a number or string.
          If you don't add a <code>break</code> statement, execution will "fall through" to the next level.
          This is very rarely what you want — in fact it's worth specifically labeling deliberate fallthrough with a comment if you really meant it to aid debugging.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Objects">
        <header>Objects</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript objects can be thought of as simple collections of name-value pairs. As such, they are similar to:
          <ul>
            <li>Dictionaries in Python.</li>
            <li>Hashes in Perl and Ruby.</li>
            <li>Hash tables in C and C++.</li>
            <li>HashMaps in Java.</li>
            <li>Associative arrays in PHP.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that this data structure is so widely used is a testament to its versatility.
          Since everything (except for core types) in JavaScript is an object, any JavaScript program naturally involves plenty of hash table lookups.
          It's a good thing they're so fast!
        </p>
        <p>
          The "name" part is a JavaScript string, while the value can be any JavaScript value — including more objects. This allows you to build data structures of arbitrary complexity.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Arrays">
        <header>Arrays</header>
        <p>
          <code>Arrays</code> in JavaScript are actually a special type of object.
          They work very much like regular objects (numerical properties can naturally be accessed only using <code>[]</code> syntax) but they have one magic property called '<code>length</code>'.
          This is always one more than the highest index in the array.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Along with objects, functions are the core component in understanding JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript <code>function</code> can take 0 or more named parameters.
           The <code>function</code> body can contain as many statements as you like and can declare its own variables which are local to that <code>function</code>.
           The <code>return</code> statement can be used to return a value at any time, terminating the function.
           If no return statement is used (or an empty return with no value), JavaScript returns <code>undefined</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The named parameters turn out to be more like guidelines than anything else.
          You can call a function without passing the parameters it expects, in which case they will be set to <code>undefined</code>.
        </p>
